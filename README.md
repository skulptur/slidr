# Slidr

I get it, removing the last vowel of a word ending with 'r' isn't cool anymore. It's ok, this slider library isn't about being Slick. It's about doing only as much as it needs to and then getting out of your way. It's tiny, it's flexible, and there are no external dependencies. Oh and you'll have to provide your own markup and styles, and yes that is a good thing (because you can use any view framework you like!).
